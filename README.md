## Branching and Merging

This repo is a simple project with a focus on how to create `branches` other than the master/main branch. All the branches are then `merged` to the master/main branch

I've also had to deal with scenarios of merge conflicts created intentionally so as to resolve them.

Demonstrated how to work with **feature branch workflow**. This obviously is not easily seen without actual practice but that was my goal creating this repo.

Having mentioned **feature branch workflow**, I have learnt on how to create `pull request` for code reviews by other developers.
